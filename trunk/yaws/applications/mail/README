This is a very basic WebMail application which is completely 
stateless, by design. I didn't want any SQL databases etc 
for storing the emails.

The reason for building it was that I needed a local WebMail
and I didn't want to install an Apache with python or PHP,
and besides all those relied on some local store (mbox, MySQL
etc) which I didn't want. Also, Klacke told me that he never
finished the other webmail app so I started from scratch.

A few important things are still missing. The most notable is the
ability to handle attached files and email on multipart format...

To install
----------

- Modify mail/defs.hrl to fit your local configuration. 
- Modify include.mk for your local paths

Run 'make' and 'make install' and update your /etc/yaws.conf
to include the ebin directory, e.g. at the top

   ebin_dir = /var/yaws/ebin

Feel free to hack it!!
