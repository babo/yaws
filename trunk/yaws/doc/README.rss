RSS Feed Interface
------------------

RSS is very cool! To see it in action look no further than Firebird 1.0.
Then go to an RSS-enabled site, e.g slashdot.org . Note the little orange
icon down in the right corner of the browser window. Click on the icon
and add the RSS-feed to you personal toolbar. Then click on your toolbar,
on the RSS-bookmark and watch the nice menu of slashdot article-summarys
popping up. 

The module yaws_rss.erl provides an RSS store/interface so that
you can RSS enable your application. More documentation can be 
found in the yaws_rss.erl file (edoc).

To setup an RSS feed
--------------------

Make sure your top page has the corresponding link information
in the 'head' part as shown in the example below:

index.html
==========
<html>
<head>
<link rel="alternate" 
      title="Example RSS" 
      href="//localhost:3080/rss.yaws" 
      type="application/rss+xml>
<title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello world
</body>
</html>
=========

The link info above refers to a file rss.yaws which
could look something like this:

rss.yaws
========
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
  <channel>
    <title>Exampel RSS feed</title>
    <link>http://www.blaha.org/</link>
    <description>
     Bla bal....
    </description>
    <language>iso8859-1</language>

<erl>

out(A) ->
    case yaws_rss:retrieve(xml) of
	{ok, Xml} ->
	    {html, [Xml]};
	_ ->
	    {html, ""}
    end.

</erl>

  </channel>
</rss>
========

To insert RSS items into the feed from your application, you
can write code like:

....
yaws_rss:insert(xml,"Yaws now support RSS feeds.",
	            "http://www.blaha.org/latest_news.html",
	            "Yaws has now been extended to support....",
                    "Bill Smith").
....

First comes a tag (which was used in rss.yaws when we retrieved
the RSS content). Then follows a Title,Link,Description and Creator.


Good luck !
