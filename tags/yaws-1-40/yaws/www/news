Jun 19, version 0.51 released. Lot's of fixes.
Return status 303 when browser asks for a dir URL without a trailing / in the http request. I've always wondered why apache does this. Now I know ... otherwise the relative URLs in /dir/index.html will be wrong when the browser tries to get them.   Utilize this feature when listing dirs now, generate relative urls instead of absolute.
Removed the default_server_on_this_ip option, the first virthosted server  in the config will be default if no Host: header is present
Made the Host: check to check for Host: host:port instead of just host when a server is run on a non-standard port. The browsers seem to set the Host: field to host:port
Tobbe added the -r flag to the startscript
Changed yaws_api:parse_post_data/1 so that it takes an arg struct as argument instead of querydata and added support for multipart form data in the process.
